# Bithyve Research

This repository contains [bithyve](https://bithyve.com) research into bitcoin ideas and primitives. Each subrepo is its own package and should build on its own without the others.

### Contributing

Please feel free to open a PR / Issue suggestion with your cool bitcoin ideas and we will try to implement them. Please note that this repo is Bitcoin only and hence we will not be implementing ideas that are out of context.
